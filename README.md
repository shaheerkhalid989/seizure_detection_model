# üß† NeuroCare: (Light) CNN‚ÄìLSTM for EEG Seizure Detection & Classification 

> Hybrid deep learning architecture for real-time seizure detection from EEG signals using the BIDS-SEINA dataset.

---

## üìå Overview

NeuroCare is a hybrid **1D CNN‚ÄìBiLSTM** model designed to detect epileptic seizures from EEG signals. This model addresses the limitations of existing models in handling **temporal dynamics**, **class imbalance**, and **real-world noise** in EEG data.

---

## üß™ Key Features

- Hybrid **CNN + BiLSTM** architecture
- **Focal loss** to improve sensitivity to seizures
- **Data augmentation** with sliding windows and synthetic generation
- Trained and evaluated on **BIDS-SEINA EEG dataset**
- Evaluation focused on **PR-AUC** and **F1-score** due to class imbalance
- Implemented in **TensorFlow 2.x**, optimized with **TFRecord**

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.12
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pyedflib
- Tqdm
- Scikit Learn
- Weights & Biases (optional)

---

## üß¨ Dataset

The BIDS-SEINA dataset includes:
- EEG recordings from 14 adult epilepsy patients (in .edf format with corresponding labels in .tsv files)
- 512 Hz sampling rate, 10‚Äì20 electrode placement
- Severe class imbalance (1 seizure to 59 background ratio)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset must be downloaded separately from its official repository.[ Click here to download BIDS-SEINA dataset.](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/bids-siena-scalp-eeg-database)

---

## üßº Preprocessing Steps

1. **Butterworth bandpass filter** (0.5‚Äì30 Hz)
2. **Notch filter** for 50/60 Hz powerline noise
3. **Z-score normalization** per EEG channel
4. **Epoch segmentation** (1‚Äì10s, 50% overlap)
5. **TFRecord serialization** for TensorFlow training

## üìà Results Summary

The model was evaluated on the BIDS-SEINA EEG dataset, which has a severe class imbalance (1 seizure to 59 background segments). Below is a summary of the model‚Äôs performance:

| **Metric**      | **Value** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Accuracy         | 88.94%    |
| Seizure F1 Score | 0.13      |
| ROC-AUC          | 0.686     |
| PR-AUC           | 0.279     |

### üî¨ Key Observations

- Removing **LSTM layers** led to a **‚àí38% drop in seizure F1 score**
- Replacing **cross-entropy** with **focal loss** improved seizure F1 by **+38%**
- Removing **data augmentation** dropped F1 by **‚àí23%**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: High accuracy may be misleading in imbalanced datasets. PR-AUC and F1-score are more informative for seizure detection performance.

## üîÅ Reproducibility

To ensure reliable and repeatable experiments, we followed best practices in data handling, training, and environment setup.

### ‚úÖ Key Steps

- **10-fold subject-wise cross-validation**  
  Ensures generalization and prevents data leakage across patients.

- **TFRecord-based data pipeline**  
  Efficient data loading using `tf.data` API with on-the-fly augmentation and prefetching.

- **Deterministic training**  
  Fixed random seeds for TensorFlow, NumPy, and Python ensure consistent runs.

- **Docker environment**  
  Provided Dockerfile for consistent dependencies and GPU/CPU behavior.

- **Experiment tracking**  
  Integrated with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for experiment logging and hyperparameter tracking.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Reproduce Our Results

```bash
# Step 1: Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/shaheerkhalid989/seizure_detection_model.git
cd seizure_detection_model

# Step 2: Install dependencies
